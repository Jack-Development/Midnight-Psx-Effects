# IMPORTANT
To enable multiple additional lights to affect the mesh, you need to go to your "Render Pipeline Asset" and set "Aditional Lights" to "Per Vertex". The shader will take care of how the lights affect the mesh (Per vertex / Pixel).

Then go to your "Universal Renderer Data" and change Rendering Path from "Forward+" to just "Forward"

## Notes
- Enabling **Dynamic LOD** has the option to **override** the **Texture Pixelization, Texture Filtering and Vertex Jittering** default settings, **giving you an extra layer of customization**.
- You can also enable Dynamic LOD and Custom LOD to mix the Texture Pixelization, Vertex Jittering and Custom Textures
- Texture Filtering Won't work with custom LOD
- **Set all your textures to point filter** in the texture settings if you want the best results.
- For a **cleaner result** while using Texture Filtering and Texture Pixelization **disable Mip Mapping** in your texture settings.
- Texture Filtering and Texture Pixelization **won't work** with Alpha Cut Outs.


## Custom Lighting Model 

The shader doesn't just crunch numbers; it embodies a custom lighting model meticulously crafted to evoke the distinctive feel and aesthetics of the original PlayStation era. With every calculation, we're not merely simulating; we're conjuring the very essence of what made PS1 games so enchanting. It's akin to embarking on a journey through time, transporting you back to those immersive late-night gaming sessions where each pixel held boundless adventure.

Whether you're a seasoned shader wizard, deftly weaving digital spells with code, or simply a nostalgic gamer longing to revive that retro charm, this bespoke lighting model is your gateway to the ultimate nostalgia trip. So fasten your seatbelt, flex those thumbs, and prepare to elevate your shader prowess to unprecedented levels as we unleash the unparalleled force of PS1 nostalgia like never before!

This step calculates the normalized direction vector of the vertex normal in object space. It discards the W component to ensure that only the directional information is retained. This directional information is crucial for lighting calculations as it determines how the surface reflects light.

$$
\overrightarrow{ND} = \frac{(\vec v.normal * [WorldToObject]).xyz}{||ND||}
$$

Computes the direction from the current vertex to the camera or viewer position in world space. Understanding where the viewer is looking from is essential for simulating realistic lighting effects such as specular highlights and reflections.

$$
\overrightarrow{VD} = \frac{(\overrightarrow{WorldSpaceCameraPosition} - ([ObjectToWorld] * \vec v.pos))} {||VD||}
$$

This step determines the direction of the light source in world space. It's crucial for both diffuse and specular lighting calculations. Depending on the setup, either the direction to a predefined light source (`WorldSpaceLight0`) or a custom light direction (`CustomLightDirection`) is used.

$$
\overrightarrow{LD} = \frac{\overrightarrow{WorldSpaceLight0}} {||WorldSpaceLight0||} or  \frac{\overrightarrow{CustomLightDirection}} {||CustomLightDirection||} 
$$

Diffuse reflections represent the light that is scattered uniformly in all directions upon hitting a surface. This calculation considers the angle between the vertex normal and the light direction, which determines how much light is reflected.

$$
\overrightarrow{DR} = atten * \overrightarrow{LightColor0} * dot(\overrightarrow{ND}, \overrightarrow{LD})
$$

Specular reflections are the highlights that appear on shiny surfaces when illuminated. This calculation involves computing the reflection of the light direction about the vertex normal (using the `reflect` function). It then determines how much of this reflected light aligns with the view direction, modulated by the material's smoothness.

$$
\overrightarrow{SR} = \overrightarrow{SpecularColor} * max(0, dot(\overrightarrow{ND}, \frac{\overrightarrow{LD}} {4})) * (max(0, dot(reflect(\frac{\overrightarrow{-LD}} {4}, \overrightarrow{ND}), \overrightarrow{VD})), Smoothness)
$$

This step calculates the outline effect by determining the angle between the view direction and the vertex normal. 

$$
\overrightarrow{OL} = 1 - saturate(dot(\frac{\overrightarrow{VD}}{||VD||}, \overrightarrow{ND}))
$$

Rim lighting simulates the effect of light scattering along the edges of objects, creating a rim or halo effect. It combines the light color with the rim color based on the angle between the vertex normal and the light direction, modulated by the outline factor and rim power.

$$
\overrightarrow{RL} = atten * \overrightarrow{LightColor0} * \overrightarrow{RimColor} * saturate(dot(\overrightarrow{ND}, \overrightarrow{LD})) * pow(\overrightarrow{OL}, RimPower) 
$$

The pixel's color is computed by combining the diffuse reflections, specular reflections, rim lighting, and any ambient color contribution. This is the culmination of all the lighting calculations and determines the visual appearance of the rendered object.

$$
\overrightarrow{FL} = \overrightarrow{DR} + \overrightarrow{SR} + \overrightarrow{RL} + \overrightarrow{CustomAmbientColor}     
$$
